Hey! I'm Mayank, CS research enthusiast, engineer, designer and developer based in Bengaluru, India. I am passionate about computers and technology and cherish analysing existing softwares and understanding their underlying algorithms.

I consider myself an adaptable learner with flexible interests in Data Science, Networks and Security, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and programming. Developing websites is something which I enjoy.
